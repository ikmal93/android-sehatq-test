    <string name="home_products_content">The Nintendo Switch was released on March 3, 2017 and is Nintendo second entry
        in the eighth generation of home video game consoles. The system was code-named Nintendo NX prior to its
        official announcement. It is a hybrid device that can be used as a home console inserted to the Nintendo Switch
        Dock attached to a television, stood up on a table with the kickstand, or as a tablet-like portable console. It
        features two detachable wireless controllers called Joy-Con, that can be used individually or attached to a grip
        to provide a more traditional game pad form. Both Joy-Con are built with motion sensors and HD Rumble, Nintendos
        haptic vibration feedback system for improved gameplay experiences. However, only the right Joy-Con has an NFC
        reader on its analog joystick for Amiibo and an IR sensor on the back. The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is a
        traditional style controller much like the one of the Gamecube.
